# Quiz Canvas App

This is a simple quiz app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, track their score, and display the result at the end. The quiz questions are shuffled each time the quiz is started to provide a unique experience.

## Features

- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Users can choose from multiple answers for each question.
- **Randomized Question Order**: The questions are shuffled each time the quiz starts, ensuring a different experience every time.
- **Score Tracking**: The app tracks the user's score as they answer questions correctly.
- **User Feedback**: Each answer is highlighted in green for correct and red for incorrect.
- **Play Again Option**: After finishing the quiz, users can play again with a fresh set of randomized questions.
- **Simple Interface**: The app has a clean and simple interface with buttons for answering questions and moving to the next one.

## Future API Integrations

In the future, we plan to integrate an API that will allow for **randomized quiz questions** fetched dynamically. The API could fetch questions based on various categories or difficulty levels. The plan includes:

- **Randomized Questions from an External API**: Instead of using predefined questions, the app will fetch questions from an external API and display them dynamically.
- **Category Selection**: Users will be able to choose the category of questions (e.g., general knowledge, science, history, etc.).
- **Difficulty Level**: Users can select the difficulty level for the quiz (easy, medium, hard).
- **User Accounts**: The app could allow users to log in and track their scores over time.
